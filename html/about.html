    <!-- This page contains info about our site. -->

    <p>
        Robin Wils founded this wiki to make it easier to find some useful interesting wiki's that you might not know about yet.
        We are developing the useful wiki with the GPL license in mind.
        It might not be under the GPL license yet but the founder of the project would loves the idea of free software so this is one of the plans for this project.
