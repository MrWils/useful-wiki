# Useful-wiki
The purpose of this project is to help people with finding the right wiki's quickly.   
People will be able to add wiki's, they will also have to add some tags so that people can find the right wiki's easily.   

# Status
The project is on hold.  
I check me email often and extra contributors are welcome.

### Frontend
CSS, HTML

### Backend
The incomplete backend is in python right now.

I am thinking of replacing the backend with H2O when I find time. I have no experience with H2O but I plan to learn some languages and H2O is one of those.

### Database
MongoDb  
(This is not defintive yet)

### License
GNU GPL license  
  
- We do not use javascript or PHP!
